# School-Bell-System

This project is an automated school bell system we developed for Saint Joseph School (Addis Ababa, Ethiopia). 
here we have shared a the source code of the application that we have developed to keep track of time and ring the bell using 
serial communication. the project solution files are the project files we just copy pasted from Visaul studio.

we developed the protype of the system we intended to implement usinng arduino Atmega256. you dont neccesarly nedd arduino 
to be able to use thios project source code. you can just implement a serial communication circuit using a micro-controller of
your choice and max-232 and modify this code to communicate through prot number of your choice. 

The application we developed and shared here is geared to import the complete school schedule from an excel file. so feel freee to 
take apart this project and get creative with it.


Don't forget to contribute back to this project so folks forking this project after you get an even better starting point. 
always share what you have accomplished so folks like you and me (coders) can save alot of coding time.


thanks, ya all!
